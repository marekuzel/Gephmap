# Gephmap
Simple python script that is able to automatically create Node and Egde table from standart Crowdtangle output (.xlsx). User is able to generate accurate Nodes table and Edges table, which can be than utilized to create network analysis. I personaly use [Gephi](https://github.com/gephi/gephi), an open source tool for graphing network maps.
